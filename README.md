# projek_dts_fe_2022
This repository contains my project with my team when we accomplish our project assignment in Digital Talent Scholarship "Intro to Frontend Developer" program by Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika Republik Indonesia and Progate in 2022.
This project were created by me and 4 others using basic HTML & CSS. I design the UI, create the Bootstrap look alike Card element, animating the HTML element and tidy up the CSS to make it responsive as possible while the others create some of the HTML element and its CSS properties. Meanwhile, it does have some defect like when we tried to see the responsive design in lower resolution devices it turns out like it was in full site mode but actually it doesnt. If you're using phone you can zoom out the page and you will see its full responsive page, but if you're using Chrome or other browser it will look like full site page but zoomed in. I dont know how to fix it right now, so please understand our struggle in making of this project.
