# projek_dts_fe_2022
This repository contains my project with my team when we accomplish our project assignment in Digital Talent Scholarship Program 2022 by Kominfo, Frontend Developer with Progate.
This project were created by me and 4 others using basic HTML & CSS. I design the UI and tidy up the CSS to make it responsive as possible. Meanwhile, it does have some defect like when we tried to see the responsive design in lower resolution devices it turns out like it was in full site mode but actually it doesnt. If you're using phone you can zoom out the page and you will see its full responsive page, but if you're using Chrome or other browser it will look like full site page but zoomed in. I dont know how to fix it right now, so please understand our struggle in making of this project.
